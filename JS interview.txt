Sure, here are some common front-end interview questions along with their answers, listed line by line under headings.

```
HTML
- What is semantic HTML, and why is it important?
  Semantic HTML uses tags that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way, such as <article>, <footer>, <header>, etc. It improves accessibility, SEO, and maintainability of the code.

- How do you create a form in HTML, and what are the key elements involved?
  Forms in HTML are created using the <form> tag, with key elements like <input>, <label>, <textarea>, <button>, and <select>. These elements allow users to input data and submit it to a server.

- How do you ensure web accessibility in your HTML code?
  To ensure accessibility, use semantic HTML, include ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes, ensure proper tab order, provide alt text for images, and use labels for form elements.

- What are some best practices for SEO in HTML?
  Use semantic HTML tags, proper heading structure (H1-H6), descriptive title tags, meta descriptions, alt attributes for images, and ensure the website is mobile-friendly and fast-loading.

CSS
- Explain the CSS box model.
  The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in the document tree and consists of margins, borders, padding, and the content area.

- How do you implement a responsive design using CSS?
  Use media queries to apply different styles based on screen size, use relative units like percentages or ems, and utilize flexible grid systems and frameworks like Bootstrap.

- What is Flexbox, and how does it work?
  Flexbox is a CSS layout module that provides a more efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic.

- How does CSS Grid layout work?
  CSS Grid Layout is a 2D grid system for the web, allowing you to design web pages using a grid-based approach with rows and columns.

- What are CSS preprocessors, and why would you use them?
  CSS preprocessors like Sass and LESS extend CSS with variables, nested rules, and functions, making CSS more maintainable and easier to write.

- Name some popular CSS frameworks and their use cases.
  Bootstrap (responsive design, UI components), Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework), Bulma (flexbox-based framework), and Foundation (responsive design).

JavaScript
- What are some new features introduced in ES6?
  Arrow functions, classes, template literals, destructuring, default parameters, rest and spread operators, let and const, promises, and modules.

- Explain the concept of promises in JavaScript.
  A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, allowing you to handle asynchronous code more cleanly.

- How does async/await work in JavaScript?
  async/await allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner. The async keyword makes a function return a promise, and await pauses the execution until the promise is resolved.

- How do you manipulate the DOM using JavaScript?
  You can manipulate the DOM using methods like getElementById, querySelector, createElement, appendChild, removeChild, and setAttribute to add, modify, or remove elements and their attributes.

- How do you handle events in JavaScript?
  Use addEventListener to attach event handlers to elements. You can handle events like clicks, keypresses, and form submissions, and define callback functions to execute when the event occurs.

- What are some differences between React, Angular, and Vue?
  React is a library focused on building UI components, Angular is a full-fledged framework for building single-page applications, and Vue is a progressive framework that can be incrementally adopted.

- How do you test JavaScript code?
  Use testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine to write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Testing libraries like Enzyme can be used to test React components.

Web Performance
- What are some techniques to optimize web performance?
  Minimize HTTP requests, use lazy loading for images, minify CSS and JavaScript files, utilize browser caching, and use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

- How does lazy loading work, and when would you use it?
  Lazy loading defers the loading of non-critical resources at page load time. Instead, these resources are loaded when needed, improving initial page load performance.

- What is code splitting, and why is it useful?
  Code splitting is a technique to split your code into smaller chunks, which can be loaded on demand. It improves performance by reducing the initial load time and loading only the necessary code.

- Explain different caching strategies.
  Caching strategies include browser caching, CDN caching, and server-side caching. These strategies store copies of resources to reduce server load and improve load times.

Web Security
- What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and how can you prevent it?
  XSS is an attack where malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites. Prevent it by sanitizing user input, using Content Security Policy (CSP), and escaping data before rendering it.

- What is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and how can you prevent it?
  CSRF is an attack that tricks the user into performing actions they didn’t intend. Prevent it by using anti-CSRF tokens, ensuring same-site cookies, and verifying request origins.

- What is a Content Security Policy (CSP), and why is it important?
  CSP is a security feature that helps prevent XSS and other attacks by specifying which content sources are trusted. It reduces the risk of malicious code execution on your site.

Version Control
- What are the basic commands in Git?
  git init, git clone, git add, git commit, git status, git push, git pull, git branch, git merge.

- How do you manage branches and merge them in Git?
  Use git branch to create and manage branches, git checkout to switch between branches, and git merge to merge changes from one branch into another.

- What is a pull request, and how do you use it?
  A pull request is a method of submitting contributions to a project. Developers create pull requests to propose changes, which can be reviewed and discussed before merging into the main branch.

- How does continuous integration work in a version-controlled environment?
  Continuous integration involves automatically testing and integrating code changes into the main branch frequently. Tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions automate the process.

Build Tools
- What is Webpack, and how do you use it?
  Webpack is a module bundler that bundles JavaScript files and other assets for use in a browser. It processes and transforms dependencies into a single file or multiple files.

- What is Babel, and why is it used in front-end development?
  Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows you to use next-generation JavaScript features by transpiling them into a version compatible with current browsers.

- What are task runners, and why are they important?
  Task runners like Gulp and Grunt automate repetitive tasks such as minification, compilation, unit testing, and linting, improving the efficiency of the development process.

Soft Skills
- How do you approach problem-solving in front-end development?
  Break down the problem, research potential solutions, prototype and test different approaches, and iteratively refine the solution based on feedback and testing results.

- How do you communicate technical concepts to non-technical team members?
  Use clear and simple language, avoid jargon, use visual aids and analogies, and ensure to relate technical details to the project’s goals and benefits.

- How do you collaborate with a team on a front-end project?
  Use version control systems like Git, participate in regular team meetings, provide and receive code reviews, and maintain clear and open communication through collaboration tools.

- Explain closures in JavaScript.
  A closure is a function that remembers the environment in which it was created. It allows the function to access variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

- What is hoisting in JavaScript?
  Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means you can use a function or variable before it is declared in the code.

- What are the differences between let, const, and var?
  var is function-scoped and can be redeclared, while let and const are block-scoped. let can be reassigned, but not redeclared in the same scope. const cannot be reassigned or redeclared.

- What is event delegation in JavaScript?
  Event delegation is a technique of using a single event listener to manage all events of a particular type for child elements, using event propagation to handle events at a higher level in the DOM.

- What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?
  == is the equality operator that compares two values for equality after performing type conversion. === is the strict equality operator that compares both value and type, ensuring no type conversion occurs.

- Explain the concept of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.
  Prototypal inheritance is a feature where objects inherit properties and methods from other objects. Each object has a prototype property, which is a reference to another object, allowing it to access properties and methods defined on that prototype.

- What is the use of the apply, call, and bind methods in JavaScript?
  apply and call are used to invoke functions with a specified `this` context. apply accepts an array of arguments, while call accepts arguments individually. bind creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

- What are arrow functions, and how do they differ from regular functions?
  Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions using the `=>` syntax. They do not have their own `this` context and cannot be used as constructors. Arrow functions also do not have the `arguments` object.

- What are JavaScript modules, and how do you use them?
  JavaScript modules allow you to split your code into reusable pieces. You can use the `import` and `export` statements to load and export modules. Modules can be imported using the `import` keyword and exported using the `export` keyword.

- How do you handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript?
  Asynchronous operations can be handled using callbacks, promises, and async/await. Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions to be executed later. Promises represent future values and allow chaining with `then` and `catch`. async/await allows writing asynchronous code in a synchronous style.

- What is the event loop in JavaScript?
  The event loop is a mechanism that handles asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It allows non-blocking I/O operations by continuously checking the call stack and the message queue. If the call stack is empty, it takes the first message from the queue and pushes it onto the stack for execution.

- What is functional programming, and how is it used in JavaScript?
  Functional programming is a programming paradigm where functions are treated as first-class citizens and emphasize immutability and avoiding side effects. In JavaScript, it is used by leveraging higher-order functions, pure functions, and methods like map, filter, and reduce.
